                    <h3>Fun Fact About Viktor Axelsen</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>His highest career ranking is 1. Brother of Johanne Axelsen. Won 3 gold medals from the 2012, 2014 and 2016 European Men's Team Championships. Won 2 gold medals from the 2009 European U17 Championships.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Axelsen started learning Chinese back in 2014, and according to him, it started as a joke that the acquisition of the language would help him become a better badminton player. As he eventually became serious with his studies, he can now visualise how it has influenced him on and off the court.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Started moving to dubai, Axelsen also considered health factors in his decision. He suffers from asthma and acute rhinitis. In Asia, this makes it more comfortable than in Europe, especially Denmark, which tends to be cooler. He even claimed to have lost about 15 to 20 percent of his lung capacity from the disease.</p></li>
